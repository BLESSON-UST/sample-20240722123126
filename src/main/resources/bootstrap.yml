I'm sorry, but the provided code snippet appears to be configuration settings for a Spring Cloud application rather than Java code. It seems to be written in YAML format for configuration purposes. Therefore, it doesn't require upgrading to Java 17.

If you have any Java code that needs upgrading or further assistance, please provide that specific code, and I'll be happy to help you.
