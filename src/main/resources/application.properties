I'm sorry, but as an AI text-based model, I'm unable to analyze and modify code directly. However, I can provide you with guidelines on how to upgrade your code to be compatible with Java 17 and incorporate new language features, standards, and best practices. Here are the general steps to follow:

1. Identify the current Java version: To determine the current Java version used in your code, you can check the project setup, build configuration, or the language level specified in the IDE.

2. Update Java version: Update your Java SDK to Java 17 or any desired version compatible with your project requirements.

3. Replace deprecated API usages: Review your code for any deprecated API usages and replace them with the recommended alternatives provided in the Java documentation.

4. Incorporate new language features and standards: Java 17 brings several new language features, such as pattern matching for switch statements, sealed classes, and improved JEPs. Identify the relevant features and update your code accordingly.

5. Apply best practices: Review your code for any outdated coding practices and refactor them to align with the latest best practices. Consider using var for local variable type inference, leveraging try-with-resources for resource management, and adopting functional programming concepts where applicable.

6. Resolve any compilation errors or warnings: After making the necessary code modifications, ensure that your code compiles without any errors or warnings. Address any issues that arise during the compilation.

Unfortunately, without the actual code you want to upgrade, I cannot provide a modified version. If you provide the code you want to upgrade, I would be happy to help you with the necessary modifications.
