The provided Java code is written in Java 8.

Here's the upgraded code compatible with Java 17, incorporating new language features, standards, and best practices:

package com.UST.departmentservice.Model;

import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import jakarta.persistence.Id;

import java.util.Objects;

public record Department(
        @Id
        @GeneratedValue
        Long departmentId,
        String departmentName,
        String departmentAddress,
        String departmentCode
) {
    public Department {
        Objects.requireNonNull(departmentId, "departmentId must not be null");
        Objects.requireNonNull(departmentName, "departmentName must not be null");
        Objects.requireNonNull(departmentAddress, "departmentAddress must not be null");
        Objects.requireNonNull(departmentCode, "departmentCode must not be null");
    }
    
    // getters and setters are not required for records
}

Please note the following changes:

1. Updated the import statements for `@Entity`, `@GeneratedValue`, and `@Id` annotations to `jakarta.persistence`.
2. Converted the class to a Java record, which is a new feature introduced in Java 14. Records eliminate boilerplate code for simple data-holding classes and provide default implementations for equals, hashCode, and toString methods.
3. Using the `Objects.requireNonNull` method to check for null values in the constructor, as records don't have explicit constructors.
4. Removed the Lombok annotations (`@Data`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, and `@AllArgsConstructor`) as they are no longer needed with the introduction of records.

This upgraded code leverages the new features and standards introduced in Java 17 while maintaining the functionality of the previous code.
